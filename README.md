### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rashmi, a Data Analytics Grad at San JosÃ© State University. I'm passionate about discovering insights from data and exploring Data Science, Analytics, Machine Learning, Large Language Models, and AGI.

Outside of my academic and professional commitments, I enjoy being in natureâ€”whether by the ocean, under the sky, or in the mountains. I'm that rare individual who negotiates the delicate alliance between being a dog and a cat person â€“ a furry diplomat if you will!
I find joy in tackling challenges and learning new things.
